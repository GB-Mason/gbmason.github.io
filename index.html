                        <h2>Hi, I'm James Mason.</h2>
                        <p>I’ve spent years leading product teams, building momentum, and delivering results. From the ground floor to the boardroom, I’ve seen what works, what doesn’t, and where companies waste time and money.</p>
                        <p>I cut through the noise. No jargon. No fluff. Just practical, focused product leadership built around one goal: making your business perform better.</p>
                        <p>Whether you're launching something new, unblocking a stalled roadmap, or building a stronger team, I bring hands-on experience and clear, honest advice to help you move faster and smarter.</p>
                        <p>Let’s build something that works and lasts.</p>

                <h2>My Experience</h2>
                <p>I’ve worked in product for over 14 years, across fintech, trading platforms, SaaS, and B2B/B2C marketplaces. I’ve held leadership roles including Head of Product and CPO, leading cross-functional teams of 70+ and managing product portfolios across multiple markets.</p>
                <p>I’ve worked in companies ranging from early-stage startups to global scale-ups, including IG, Genius Sports, and Oval Money. I’ve built teams from scratch, turned around struggling products, and led platform-wide strategy shifts under pressure.</p>
                <p>I'm comfortable switching between high-level strategy and day-to-day delivery. Whether I’m helping a founder shape their roadmap or working with engineers to unblock delivery, my focus is always on practical outcomes.</p>
                <p>I now work independently, offering product leadership support to teams who need clarity, momentum, and experience on their side.</p>

                            When I'm not untangling product challenges, I'm usually found chasing two energetic young kids around, trying to shave seconds off my 5k time (sub-20 min is the goal!), or perfecting my drop shot on the badminton court. My partner and I keep life busy, balanced, and fun.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For me, the discipline and drive I bring to a marathon training block is the same energy I apply to a complex product roadmap. It’s about setting clear goals, putting in the consistent effort, and enjoying the process. That Yorkshire grit helps too!
