                        <h2>Hi, I'm James Mason</h2> <p>I’ve spent years leading product teams, building momentum, and delivering results. From the ground floor to the boardroom, I’ve seen what works, what doesn’t, and where companies waste time and money.</p>
                        <p>I cut through the noise. No jargon. No fluff. Just practical, focused product leadership built around one goal: making your business perform better.</p>
                        <p>Whether you're launching something new, unblocking a stalled roadmap, or building a stronger team, I bring hands-on experience and clear, honest advice to help you move faster and smarter.</p>
                        <p>Let’s build something that works and lasts.</p>

                <h2>My Experience</h2>
                <p>I’ve worked in product for over 14 years, across fintech, trading platforms, SaaS, and B2B/B2C marketplaces. I’ve held leadership roles including Head of Product and CPO, leading cross-functional teams of 70+ and managing product portfolios across multiple markets.</p>
                <p>I’ve worked in companies ranging from early-stage startups to global scale-ups, including IG, Genius Sports, and Oval Money. I’ve built teams from scratch, turned around struggling products, and led platform-wide strategy shifts under pressure.</p>
                <p>I'm comfortable switching between high-level strategy and day-to-day delivery. Whether I’m helping a founder shape their roadmap or working with engineers to **optimize** delivery, my focus is always on practical outcomes.</p> <p>I now work independently, offering product leadership support to teams who need clarity, momentum, and experience on their side.</p>

                        <p>I run regularly and enjoy the rhythm of structured training. Intervals, long runs, and the occasional muddy Parkrun are all part of the mix.</p>
                        <p>I also play badminton, mess around on the guitar, and have a habit of getting stuck into DIY projects. Whether it’s laying a patio or wiring garden lights, I like figuring things out and making them work.</p>
                        <p>I’ve got two young kids, aged 8 and 9, who keep life busy, noisy, and brilliant.</p>
